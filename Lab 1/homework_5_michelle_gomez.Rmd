#Exercise 1  
```{r}
mosaicData::Whickham
?Whickham
```
1. What variables are in this data set?  
There are 2 categorical variables (outcome, smoker) and one quantitative variable (age).  
```{r}
class(Whickham)
names(Whickham)
```
2. How many observations are there and what does each represent?  
There are 1,314 observations/rows.   
```{r}
count(Whickham)
```
3. Create a table (use the R code below as a guide) and a visualization of the relationship between smoking status and outcome, ignoring age. What do you see? Does it make sense?  
```{r}
library(mosaicData)
library(tidyverse)
Whickham %>% count(smoker, outcome) %>%
  arrange_all()
```
